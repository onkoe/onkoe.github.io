## Self Introduction

Hi, I'm Onkoe! I like to help people with technology! I'm interested in virtual reality and open source software. 

## Some Interests  

Open Source Software:
- I maintain a list of F-Droid alternatives to Google Apps and AOSP apps alike.
- While I'm no purist, I generally prefer FOSS because it tends to be more comfy!
- When possible, I switch to FOSS solutions when they become sensible. 

Virtual Reality:
- I'm a big fan of Bigscreen, VRChat, and Neos!
- Preferably, I would use FOSS alternatives to these platforms. 
- ...but I still use them. :)
